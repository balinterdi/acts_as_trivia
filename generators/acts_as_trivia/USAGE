Description:

    The acts_as_trivia generator will generate a controller for the model class that is given as the first parameter. For each action (trivia question) passed in the command line it will also generate a view with the corresponding name, a route in the routes file and the acts_as_trivia line itself in the model.
    
Example:
    ./script/generate acts_as_trivia country hdi name
        ...
        create  app/controllers/country_trivia_controller.rb
        create  app/views/country_trivia/hdi.html.erb
        create  app/views/country_trivia/population.html.erb
        create  app/views/country_trivia/gdp.html.erb
        route   map.with_options(:controller => 'country_trivia') do ...
