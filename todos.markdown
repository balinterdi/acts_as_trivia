* think about the routing scheme/form setup that answering a trivia will have.

  A TriviaAnswer instance will need to be created when the user answers the trivia, so ideally the route would be something like this:
  
  /users/1/trivia_answers/new
  
  But then how is the trivia (e.g country-hdi) identified from the URL?
  
  The current setup is
  
  /trivias/2/ (or /trivias/country-hdi)
  
  But then the URL is not that nice as before, and the controller code will have to fetch the current_user and create the TriviaAnswer explicitly. Not bad, but not perfect either. What about the following:
  
  /users/1/trivias/2/trivia_answers/new
  
  Can that be the perfect solution?
  
* add the following methods to the user:

  * add_trivia(trivia)
  * played_trivia?(trivia)
  * trivia_points

* think about how trivias will call the appropriate method on the appropriate class

  for:
  
  class Country
    acts_as_trivia :hdi
    ...
  end
  
  an appropriate trivia will have to be generated (let a migration be generated by the generator):
  
  Trivia.create(:on => "country", :about => "hdi")
    
  This generator can be another one since this one should be called for each subsequent trivia question the developer comes up with.
