* add the following methods to the user:

  * add_trivia(trivia)
  * played_trivia?(trivia)
  * trivia_points

* think about how trivias will call the appropriate method on the appropriate class

  for:
  
  class Country
    acts_as_trivia :hdi
    ...
  end
  
  an appropriate trivia will have to be generated (let that be generated by the generator):
  
  Trivia.create(:on => "country", :about => "hdi")
  
  And when that trivia is played (its show view is fetched)
  
  the country has to be found and its trivia_answer_for("hdi") method called.
